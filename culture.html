    <h1>Culture</h1>
    <p>eThe United States is a multicultural nation, home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and
        values. With the exception of the already small Native American and Native Hawaiian populations, nearly
        all Americans or their ancestors have emigrated within the past five centuries. Their culture is
        exercised in commo
        n by most Americans and is Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European
        immigrants, with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.
        More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been
        described as both homogenized and heterogeneous, as immigrants and their descendants maintain cultural
        specificities.</p>

It's Friday night in the United States, and an autumn ritual is taking place across the country. Cheerleaders prepare their pompoms. Marching band members warm up their musical instruments. Teenage boys gather in sports gym locker rooms to put on their protective equipment, adjust their cleats and prepare to enter packed stadiums lit by huge spotlights. It's high school football season and for many Americans this is the best season ever. (In the United States, autumn corresponds to the months of September, October and November).

American football — which should not be confused with soccer, the 90-minute game where people use their feet and which Americans call “soccer” — is less about the game itself and more about everything it inspires. For players, it's about working hard as a team in order to achieve something no one person could do. Coaches use sport as a metaphor for life, with lessons about overcoming obstacles. Fans love the sense of solidarity the sport creates, with cheerleaders, dance teams and band members all present to keep the enthusiasm level high.
